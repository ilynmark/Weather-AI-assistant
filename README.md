# Weather AI assistant
AI-powered weather assistant that extracts location information from user input, retrieves the temperature, translates it to another language, generates an audio response using OpenAI Speech API, creates an image using DALL-E, and utilizes OpenAI's Vision Preview to extract text from the image.

## **Project Description:**

This project is an AI-powered weather assistant designed to extract location information from user input, retrieve the temperature, translate it to another language, generate an audio response using OpenAI Speech API, create an image using DALL-E, and utilize OpenAI's Vision Preview to extract text from the image. At the end, it creates a Chainlit application.

## **How to Use:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
```{r}
git clone https://github.com/marmiskarian/Weather-AI-assistant.git
cd Weather-AI-assistant
```

2. **Install Requirements:**
```{r}
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the Application:**
```{r}
chainlit run app.py
```

4. **Using the Chainlit Application:**
- Once the application is running, you can interact with it by sending messages.
- The application will extract location information from your input, fetch the weather data, translate it, create an audio response, generate an image, and extract text from the image.
- You will receive responses at each step of the process.

Feel free to explore and customize the application as needed!
